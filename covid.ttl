The official OBI definition, explaining the meaning of a class or property: 'Shall be Aristotelian, formalized and normalized. Can be augmented with colloquial definitions'  is terrible.

Can you fix to something like:

A statement of necessary and sufficient conditions explaining the meaning of an expression referring to a class or property.

Alan Ruttenberg

Your proposed definition is a reasonable candidate, except that it is very common that necessary and sufficient conditions are not given. Mostly they are necessary, occasionally they are necessary and sufficient or just sufficient. Often they use terms that are not themselves defined and so they effectively can't be evaluated by those criteria.

On the specifics of the proposed definition:

We don't have definitions of 'meaning' or 'expression' or 'property'. For 'reference' in the intended sense I think we use the term 'denotation'. For 'expression', I think we you mean symbol, or identifier. For 'meaning' it differs for class and property. For class we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine whether an entity is instance of the class, or not. For property we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine, given a pair of potential relata, whether the assertion that the relation holds is true. The 'intended reader' part suggests that we also specify who, we expect, would be able to understand the definition, and also generalizes over human and computer reader to include textual and logical definition.

Personally, I am more comfortable weakening definition to documentation, with instructions as to what is desirable.

We also have the outstanding issue of how to aim different definitions to different audiences. A clinical audience reading chebi wants a different sort of definition documentation/definition from a chemistry trained audience, and similarly there is a need for a definition that is adequate for an ontologist to work with.

Thus there is here no counterpart of ‘object’. In BFO 1.0 ‘process’ served as such a counterpart. In BFO 2.0 ‘process’ is, rather, the occurrent counterpart of ‘material entity’. Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay.

Such units play a central role in almost all domains of natural science from particle physics to cosmology. Many scientific laws govern the units in question, employing general terms (such as ‘molecule’ or ‘planet’) referring to the types and subtypes of units, and also to the types and subtypes of the processes through which such units develop and interact. The division of reality into such natural units is at the heart of biological science, as also is the fact that these units may form higher-level units (as cells form multicellular organisms) and that they may also form aggregates of units, for example as cells form portions of tissue and organs form families, herds, breeds, species, and so on. At the same time, the division of certain portions of reality into engineered units (manufactured artifacts) is the basis of modern industrial technology, which rests on the distributed mass production of engineered parts through division of labor and on their assembly into larger, compound units such as cars and laptops. The division of portions of reality into units is one starting point for the phenomenon of counting."@en, "BFO 2 Reference: Each object is such that there are entities of which we can assert unproblematically that they lie in its interior, and other entities of which we can assert unproblematically that they lie in its exterior.

The first encounter with antigen elicits a primary immune response that is slow and not of great magnitude. T and B cells selected by antigen become activated and undergo clonal expansion. A fraction of antigen-reactive T and B cells become memory cells, whereas others differentiate into effector cells.

In contrast the stress-induced homeostatically regulated protein degradation (SHRED) pathway (GO:0120174), although inducible by stress, targets diverse ER membrane, and cytosolic proteins as well as numerous other native proteins in the absence of stress. Stress results in the protease-mediated (Nma111p) generation of a Roq1p cleavage product that then binds to the type-1 active site of Ubr1p, altering its substrate specificity, and leading to the proteasome-mediated degradation of both misfolded and native proteins. Although the SHRED pathway may contain some components in common with ERAD pathways (GO:0036503), such as UBR1, RAD6 and CDC48, other ERAD components, such as HRD1 and DOA10, do not appear to be involved, and as such these pathways are currently considered to be distinct." ;

They are defined as the time (seconds) needed to clot platelet-poor plasma upon addition of coagulation triggers, such as tissue factor in complex with phospholipids and calcium chloride (in the PT), or negatively charged phospholipids-activators and calcium chloride (in the APTT). They can hence be considered as global coagulation tests sensitive to deficiencies of many coagulation factors. In brief, they are both sensitive to factor X, V, II and fibrinogen, whereas the PT is only sensitive to factor VII deficiency and the APTT is sensitive to pre-kallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), factor XII, XI, IX and VIII deficiencies. Normal plasma in the PT clots approximately within 10-12 s upon triggering coagulation, and the normal reference range is (usually) narrow. PT results have been reported as clotting time, percentage activity, PT-ratio (patient-to-normal clotting time) and as international normalized ratio (INR). The INR scale has been devised to harmonize results stemming from different thromboplastins from patients on treatment with vitamin K antagonists. Some recommend abandoning the approach of using percentage activity to assess PR." ;

It can be divided into 3 sections including the amino terminus of the PCT region, immature calcitonin, and calcitonin carboxyl-terminus peptide-1 (CCP-1). Procalcitonin is encoded by CALC-1 gene located on chromosome 11. Cleavage in 1 site of the primary transcript of CALC-1 gene produces pre-PCT, which further undergoes proteolytic cleavage of its signal sequence to produce PCT. The synthesized PCT then undergoes post-translational processing to produce small peptides and mature CT. PCT is a biomarker that exhibits greater specificity than other proinflammatory markers (eg, cytokines) in identifying patients with sepsis and can be used in the diagnosis of bacterial infections. The short half-life (25-30 hours in plasma) of PCT, coupled with its virtual absence in health and specificity for bacterial infections, gives it a clear advantage over the other markers of bacterial infection." ;

Upon administration, leronlimab targets and binds to CCR5 expressed on T-cells. This blocks HIV cell entry, which prevents HIV infection and/or reduces HIV viral load. In addition, blocking CCR5 by PRO 140 decreases CCR5-mediated signaling and the CCR5-induced migration of donor cells into tissues after an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Blocking CCR5 may therefore prevent or reduce GvHD. CCR5, a co-receptor needed for HIV cell entry, plays a key role in immunomodulation. Expressed on monocytes, activated T-cells and dendritic cells (DCs), CCR5 can regulate chemotaxis. Lymphocyte trafficking via chemokine receptors, such as CCR5, and recruitment to target organs, plays a critical role in alloreactive responses." ;

Upon administration of the poly IC/inactivated RV-V YS-ON-001, the RV-V stimulates the immune system in various ways, such as promoting the activation and proliferation of T helper type 1 (Th1) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), B cells and natural killer cells (NKs), promoting macrophage M1 polarization, downregulating regulatory T-cells (Tregs), and inducing the production of anti-tumor cytokines. This re-activates immune responses in the suppressed tumor microenvironment (TME), leading to an induction of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against the tumor cells, which cause tumor cell apoptosis and a reduction of tumor cell proliferation. Poly IC, a synthetic double-stranded RNA with one strand composed of a inosinic acid polymer and the other strand a cytidylic acid polymer, binds to TLR3 and stimulates the release of cytotoxic cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFNg).

  ns0:IAO_0000116 "Melanie Courtot and YH: More work is needed on how to restrict the scope of a term to be an 'adverse event', notably regarding temporal association. When is an appropirate time interval between a medical intervention and an adverse event observed? One week, one month, one year, or a lifetime? For some well-studied medical interventions (e.g., administration of many vaccines or drugs), we probably have a general idea. For many new interventions, we don't know much. In OAE, this issue is associated with defining the 'adverse event incubation time'.", "YH: An adverse event is a process that has specified output of some adverse medical outcome (e.g., symptom, sign or accident) after a medical intervention (or process) (e.g., administration of drug or vaccine). The medical intervention can be an administration of a drug, a vaccine (i.e., vaccination), or a special nutritional product (for example, dietary supplement, infant formula, medical food), surgery, or usage of a medical device.", "YH: An adverse event is possibly induced by the medical intervention. It can be caused by the medical intervention, or may not be caused by the medical intervention. One ultimate goal (or the goal in clinics) of study adverse events is to assess if the adverse event outcome is due to the medical intervention.", """YH: In development of OAE, we initially use vaccine adverse event as our use case. A vaccine adverse event is associated with a vaccination (i.e. a medical intervention), regardless of whether it is considered vaccine-related, and includes any side effect, injury, toxicity, or sensitivity reaction or significant failure of immunization (i.e., a pharmacologic action).

Adverse Event Representation Workshop, International Conference on Biomedical Ontologies (ICBO), University at Buffalo, NY, July 26-30, 2011. Full lenghth conference proceeding paper.  

We  made the name changing in order to make OAE cover the broader sense of the 'adverse event' which does not assume definite causal effect between an adverse event and a medical intervention. In current definition, the adverse event emphasizes the time association and assumes a likelihood of such a causal association. This term 'adverse event' is stil under the OGMS:pathological bodily process.

The 'adverse event' defined in the above paper has now been changed to a new term: 'causal adverse event'.

In AERO, the term 'AERO:adverse event' represents a subset of those adverse events for which causality has been established. In OAE, an adverse event for which causality has been established is called 'causal adverse event'." ;

  ns0:IAO_0000116 """2012-12-17 JAO: In common lab usage, there is a distinction made between devices and reagents that is difficult to model. Therefore we have chosen to specifically exclude reagents from the definition of "device", and are enumerating the types of roles that a reagent can perform.

2013-6-5 MHB: The following clarifications are outcomes of the May 2013 Philly Workshop. Reagents are distinguished from devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during the realization of their experimental role. By contrast, devices do not participate in such chemical reactions/interactions.  Note that there are cases where devices use reagent components during their operation, where the reagent-device distinction is less clear.  For example:

(1) An HPLC machine is considered a device, but has a column that holds a stationary phase resin as an operational component.  This resin qualifies as a device if it participates purely in size exclusion, but bears a reagent role that is realized in the running of a column if it interacts electrostatically or chemically with the evaluant. The container the resin is in (“the column”) considered alone is a device. So the entire column as well as the entire HPLC machine are devices that have a reagent as an operating part.

(2) A pH meter is a device, but its electrode component bears a reagent role in virtue of its interacting directly with the evaluant in execution of an assay.

(3) A gel running  box  is a device that has a metallic lead as a component that participates in a chemical reaction with the running buffer when a charge is passed through it.  This metallic lead is considered to have a reagent role as a component of this device realized in the running of a gel.

In the examples above, a reagent is an operational component of a device, but the device itself does not realize a reagent role (as bearing a reagent role is not transitive across the part_of relation).  In this way, the asserted disjointness between a reagent and device holds, as both roles are never realized in the same bearer during execution of an assay.  """ ;

In addition, the zebrafish liver does not have Kuppfer cells. Furthermore, a clear distinction can be made between the male and female liver in the adult zebrafish. The female hepatocytes are very basophilic (Figure 15c) as a result of the production of vitellogenin (Van der Ven et al. 2003).", "The liver is found in all vertebrates, and is typically the largest visceral organ. Its form varies considerably in different species, and is largely determined by the shape and arrangement of the surrounding organs.
